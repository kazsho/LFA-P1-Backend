# The Exceptional's Art Recognition Game

## Description

An art recognition game aimed at children ages 14+ to test their knowledge on famous artists! Access the project here: https://henriettacodes.github.io/LFA---P1---Frontend/

This project was created following a brief we were provided as a team, where we had a problem statement to address. A secondary school has faced a problem, where they noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects, over the last two years and need a solution on how they can overcome this. We were tasked to come up with a solution that places engaging learning as well improved retention of the knowledge at the heart of the learning experience. When looking at a list of subjects taught in secondary schools, as a group we decided art/art history was the one we had the most interest and appreciation for. We put our efforts into creating a solution for the school to overcome their main concerns, in turn increasing student performance in non-STEM subjects.

## Installation & Usage
* Github pages link used in render server: https://henriettacodes.github.io/LFA---P1---Frontend/
* Render link: https://lfa-project1-backend.onrender.com
* Clone the project from the repo here: git@github.com:kazsho/LFA-P1-Backend.git
* Open your terminal and cd into the directory for where you’ve saved the project e.g cd Desktop / cd LFA_P1_Backend
* Once inside the directory in your terminal run: npm init → npm install express → npm install cors - npm install -D nodemon
* Lastly in your terminal enter: code . which will open the project.
* Inside the artists.json file is the json data for the application which is used for the game.
* Inside app.js here theres a get request when landing on painting-recognition which is what sends the artistdata.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

## Technologies 
* Javascript
* Express
* Cors
* Github pages
* Render

## Process
* Deciding the subject of the game and what the pupil will take from it, ensuring this is reflected on the requirements from the brief.
* Designing the user-flow within the application.
* Choosing the artists who the pupils will be tested against and later to be used to create a JSON file with all the information the quiz is based on.
* Low/Hi-fidelity mockups.
* Creating webpages in HTML/CSS.
* Creation of backend using Express.js, linking it with the front-end.
* Deployment of the project using github pages & render

## Wins & Challenges 
### Wins:
* Deployment of our functional game.
* Dynamic information used to power the game.

### Challenges:
* The backend server needed to be 'spun up' in order to operate as efficiently as we planned. This was remedied by adding a fetch request on the dashboard page to 'wake up' the backend server.

## Future features:
* A database enabling working user-profiles, score-system & social leader-board.
* More data held so the game can be based on the original 4 artists we decided on.
* Additional game modes.
* A dashboard for teachers to add further artists + tests. As well as letting them know how the students are performing.
